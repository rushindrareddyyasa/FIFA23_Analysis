# FIFA 23 Player Data Analysis & Power BI Dashboard

This project showcases end-to-end analysis of the FIFA 23 player dataset using Python for preprocessing and Power BI for visualization. The notebook walks through data cleaning and transformation, while the dashboard highlights key insights into player performance, value, and demographics.

## 📁 Files Included

- `analysis_commented.ipynb`: Python notebook used for data cleaning and feature engineering.
- `dashboard_image.png`: Snapshot of the final Power BI dashboard.
- `dashboard_video.mp4`: A short demo video of the interactive dashboard (to be added).
  
## 🔍 Key Highlights from the Notebook

- Removed non-essential columns like `Photo`, `Flag`, and `Loaned From`
- Transformed string monetary columns (`Wage`, `Value`, `Release Clause`) into numeric values
- Extracted insights from:
  - Age, Wage, Value, Overall, Potential, Position, Nationality, and more
- Created a cleaned dataset: `processed_fifa.csv` for Power BI
